## Overview

AirGuard is a decentralized platform designed to help users recover airdropped tokens from compromised wallets before sweeper bots can steal them. Built on top of the Drosera Network and integrated with advanced MEV protection, AirGuard enables users to regain access to what is rightfully theirs—even after their private keys have been compromised.

---

## The Problem

Airdrops are supposed to reward early adopters and committed community members. Unfortunately, many qualifying wallets have already been compromised—whether through phishing, leaked keys, or dormant exposure—long before the airdrop takes place.

When the claim window opens, sophisticated bots quickly detect, claim, and extract tokens from these wallets using high-speed automation and MEV tactics. Victims have no realistic way to respond in time, and countless airdrops are lost every year to these bots.

---

## The Solution

AirGuard offers a proactive recovery mechanism that protects users from automated exploitation. It continuously monitors compromised wallets, detects airdrop activity in real-time, calculates recovery priority based on urgency and token value, and executes MEV-protected recovery transactions to transfer the tokens to a designated safe wallet.

By leveraging the decentralized operator infrastructure of the Drosera Network, AirGuard ensures that no single party has full control of the system and that recovery operations remain transparent, verifiable, and community-driven.

---

## How It Works

AirGuard starts by tracking registered compromised wallets across multiple blockchains. Whenever a new airdrop becomes claimable or token activity is detected, it evaluates the risk level and triggers a recovery based on the wallet's preconfigured strategy. Users define their safe destination wallet, gas preferences, DEX routing, and whether recoveries should be automatic or manual.

To ensure transaction security, AirGuard integrates directly with Flashbots, Merkle, and MEVBlocker to shield transactions from front-runners and sandwich attacks. These transactions are sent privately to miners or validators through MEV relays, giving them priority without broadcasting them publicly.

All recovery logic is executed through smart contracts deployed on-chain, with decentralized operators from the Drosera Network handling the off-chain orchestration. These operators are whitelisted, rewarded for successful recoveries, and subject to network accountability.

## Why AirGuard Matters

Crypto users often lose access to valuable airdrops not because they’re inactive, but because their wallets were silently compromised long ago. AirGuard turns the tables on that injustice by giving victims a path to safely recover their assets before they’re swept away by bots.

This platform defends the spirit of decentralization and fairness. By building a system that prioritizes user sovereignty, security, and automation, AirGuard restores balance and trust to the airdrop ecosystem.

## Future Plans

AirGuard is just getting started. The roadmap includes:

- AI-powered airdrop prediction models
- Support for Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism)
- Automated bridging and reinvestment strategies
- Native mobile application
- Governance token to reward operators and contributors

All aimed at enabling a decentralized, community-led evolution of the platform.

## About the Creator

AirGuard was created by [@Love_Light_11](https://x.com/Love_Light_11), a builder focused on protecting users, automating on-chain processes, and promoting equitable access to crypto-native opportunities. This project reflects a commitment to strengthening the social layer of Web3 and fighting back against MEV exploitation.

## Ethical Use Warning

AirGuard is designed exclusively for the recovery of assets from wallets you personally own or control. Attempting to use the platform for unauthorized access or recovery is strictly forbidden. All actions on the platform are subject to logging, monitoring, and community governance enforcement.
